2. list all the languages spoken in the 'Southeast Asia' region
3. What the population and average life expectancy for people in Argentina (ARG) ?
4. What is the number of cities in the USA ?
5. What is the capital of Spain (ESP) ? 
6. Which country has the highest population?
7. Which country has the least number of people?
8. what country has the highest life expectancy?

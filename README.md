# MYSQL-World_Data
The script is in the Master Branch :) 
This project explores the MySQL sample World database. Checking for Population Density, Languages Spoken in certain regions etc.

I dabbled with data retrieval answering the below questions
1. Which is the most densely populated country in the world?
2. list all the languages spoken in the 'Southeast Asia' region
3. What the population and average life expectancy for people in Argentina (ARG) ?
4. What is the number of cities in the USA ?
5. What is the capital of Spain (ESP) ? 
6. Which country has the highest population?
7. Which country has the least number of people?
8. what country has the highest life expectancy?

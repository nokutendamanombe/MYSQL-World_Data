# MYSQL-World_Data
The queries are in the Master Branch :) 

This project explores the MySQL sample World database. Checking for Population Density, Languages Spoken in certain regions etc.

I dabbled with data retrieval, filtering data based on conditions, joining tables, aggregating data, modifying data, and deleting records

The Questions I answered are :

1. Retrieve the names of all cities.
2. Countries in the that have a population greater than 100 million.
3. Get the official languages and their percentages for a specific country.
4. Retrieve the name of each city along with its corresponding country name.
5. Find the countries in a specific continent and display the cities within those countries?
6.Calculate the total population for each continent.
7.Find the average GNP (Gross National Product) for each region
8.Insert a new city
9.Update the population of a specific city
10.Delete a record from the "country" table based on a specific condition

   Update 
1. Which is the most densely populated country in the world?
2. list all the languages spoken in the 'Southeast Asia' region
3. What the population and average life expectancy for people in Argentina (ARG) ?
4. What is the number of cities in the USA ?
5. What is the capital of Spain (ESP) ? 
6. Which country has the highest population?
7. Which country has the least number of people?
8. what country has the highest life expectancy?

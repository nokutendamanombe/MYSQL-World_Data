# MYSQL-World_Data
The queries are in the Master Branch :) 

This project explores the MySQL sample World database. Checking for Population Density, Languages Spoken in certain regions etc.

I dabbled with data retrieval, filtering data based on conditions, joining tables, aggregating data, modifying data, and deleting records

The Questions I answered are :

1. Retrieve the names of all cities.
2. Countries in the that have a population greater than 100 million.
3. Get the official languages and their percentages for a specific country.
4. Retrieve the name of each city along with its corresponding country name.
5. Find the countries in a specific continent and display the cities within those countries?
6.Calculate the total population for each continent.
7.Find the average GNP (Gross National Product) for each region
8.Insert a new city
9.Update the population of a specific city
10.Delete a record from the "country" table based on a specific condition
   
1. Which is the most densely populated country in the world?
